###### python module

```

Important rules for the main configuration file auditd.conf
```
The maximum log file size in MB. When this capacity is reached, the actions specified by max_log_file _action are executed
# (if the file is set too small, a large number of files will be generated. You can set the appropriate size)
Max_log_file = 6

Action taken when max_log_file's log file size is reached. The values must be one of IGNORE, SYSLOG, SUSPEND, ROTATE, and KEEP_LOGS.
# IGNORE: no action will be taken if the log file reaches max_log_file.
# SYSLOG: a warning is written to system log /var/log/messages when the file size is reached.
SUSPEND: does not write an audit message to the log file after its file capacity has been reached.
# ROTATE: loops around log files as the specified file size is reached, but only a certain number of old files are saved, specified by the num_logs parameter.
The name of the old file will be audit.log.n, where N is a number. The larger the number, the older the file.
# KEEP_LOGS: the log file is looped, but the num_logs parameter is ignored, so no log files are deleted.
#
# (this configuration does not need to be moved)
Max_log_file_action = ROTATE

```

Configuration rules (infinite nodes)

```
# custom rule configuration reference instance (conf/audit_rules_conf.json) :

{
    "web01":{
        "/data/www/web":"-p rwa",
        "/data/www/vendor":"-p rwa"
    },
    "web02":{
        "/data/www/web":"-p rwa",
        "/data/www/vendor":"-p rwa"
    },
    "web03":{
        "/data/www/web":"-p rwa",
        "/data/www/vendor":"-p rwa"
    },
    "web0N":{
